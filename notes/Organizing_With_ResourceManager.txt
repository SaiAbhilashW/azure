Resource Groups

A resource must have one and only one resource group.
Ways of organizing in resource groups :
- Logical : similar resource in a group
- Lifecycle : usually in non-production envs where you are experimenting and clean up everything after practice
- Authorisation : apply RBAC to all resources in the group
- Billing

Ways of creating resource group => portal, powershell, Azure CLI, SDKs

Tags

- key value pairs of text data which can be attached to resource or resource group
- allow you to associate custom details about the resource/groups
- a resource can have many tags (upto 50)
- tags applied to resource group are not inherited to resources in it
- uses : billing a resource group together
	   : monitoring rgs, 
	   : easy retrival of resources based on similar tags
	   : automation, switch off rgs having a particular tag during off hours

- inherited among the contained resources

			: Read-Only - doesn't allow modification and deletion
