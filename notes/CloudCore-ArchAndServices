Understanding Datacentres and Regions

Regions - geographical areas having one or more datacenters
		- datacentres are networked together over low latency network

	- US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa 
		- physically and logically isolated regions
		- For US govt agencies and partners

Availability Zones - Physically seperated datacenters within azure an region
				   - has one or more datacenters with independent setups
				   - Good to have 3 availability zones for resiliency
				   - for mission critical apps needing high availability
				   - app clones all its resources, data and stores in another datacenter

Region Pair - two regions in same geography (like East US, West US) 
			- entire setup replicated 
			- relaible service & redunduncy of data
			- helps in planned updates, when one region works other is updating

SLA - Performance, Uptime guarantees, Credits on failure to meet performance and availability guarantees 
	- for downtime SLA*365 days 
	- no SLA for free or shared products/services
	- Single VM instance - premium storage - 99.9% SLA
	- VMs with two or more instances in same availability set - 99.95% SLA
	- VMs with two or more instances deployed across two or more availability zones - 99.99% SLA
	e.g 
						--- SQL Db (99.99)
	(99.95) Web App ---|
						--- Queue (99.9)

	% possibility both Sql db and queue fail = 1 - (0.01/100 * 0.1/100) = 99.99999 percent
	combined SLA => 99.95 * 99.99999 ~ 99.95

Resiliency - Ability of app to recover from failures and continue to function
