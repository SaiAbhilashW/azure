* Regardless of the deployment type, you always retain responsibility for the following items:
Data
Endpoints
Accounts
Access management

* Defence in depth - security in layers, even if one is breached other protects

Layers :
Data - Hackers want it most, keep it secure
Application - No vulnerabilities in app, focus on security while developing
Compute - Secure access to VMs
Networking - Limit inbound internet, restrict outbound internet
Perimeter - Use DDoS to negate any large scale attacks
Identity and access - Use SSO and MFA, control access to users
Physical - Datacenters should be secure

Azure Security Center 

Two Tiers
Free - recommendations of azure resources
Standard - continuous monitoring and threat detection (comes with standard tier subscription)

Azure Active Directory

* Identity Service
* Provides Authentication - self service password reset, MFA, SSO
* Autherization
* Synchronises on-premise active directory, can also work on itsef
* One identity across all the apps

* A specific org's active directory account is known as Active Directory Tenant

Identities to services - users can access configuration info from services so :
* Service Principals - principal is an identity which can be assigned some roles like admin etc which can tell how much access should be given to that identity
* Managed Identity - You create an account on your org's Active Directory and system will take care of it

*Azure AD Priviledged Identity Management - Paid Portal which gives oversight of rbacs applied and all that idenity stuff

* Encryption -
 Symmetric - same key to encrypt and decrypt data
 Asymetric - public and private key to decrypt, anyone alone can encrypt
 
 Encryption at Rest - data just kept somewhere in encrypted form
 Encryption in transit - data moving, encrypt at application layer like HTTPS or send data through a VPN

 Azure Disk Encryption - BitLocker for Windows and dm-crypt for linux, integrated with Azure Key Vault

 Encrypt databases - Transperent Data Encryption (TDE) , bring your own key (BYOK) feature also available

 Azure Key Vault - For storing all kinds of passwords, encrypt/decrypt keys, Api keys etc

 Certificates - Service certs - In azure
 			  - Management certs - from SDKs like Visual Studio etc

 Azure Firewall - allows only a specific range of IP addrs to access servers. Protection for RDP, SSH, FTP and HTTPs

* Azure Application Gateway - Is a load balancer which has  Web Application Firewall which protects HTTP traffic

* Network Virtual Appliances - hardware firewall appliances 

* Network Security Groups - For protection inside Vnet, NSG contains resources and has restrictions on IP, port and protocol of resources which can talk to this resource

* ExpressRoute - private connections between your on-premise infra and Microsoft Cloud, like VPN

* Azure Information Protect (AIP) - Protects emails and documents by applying labels to each one and classifying them accordingly

* Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) - threat detection and analysis

Protect Your Network

- Layered approach

	- Internet facing resources
		- allow inbound and outbound traffic only when neccesary
		- Azure Security Center identifies internet facing resources without security groups
		  or those which are not behind the firewall.

	Firewall - Allows server access to only a selected range of IP addresses defined by you
		-	Azure Firewall - Firewall as a service by azure, inbound protection for Remote Desktop
			Protocol, File Transfer Protocol and Secure Shell
		-	Azure Application gateway - load balancer includes Web App Firewall, for HTTP traffic

	Network Virtual appliances - ideal for non HTTP services


- Stopping Distributed Denial of Service Attacks
	These attacks attempt to overwhelm a resource by sending too many requests
	- Azure DDoS protection identifies the attacker and blocks him while letting customers access the service

- Controlling traffic inside the VNet
	- Network Security Gropus => Allow us to control traffic between azure resources in the vnet
	- ExpressRoute - establish VPN connection between with azure and your on premise network


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protecting shared documents

Microsoft Azure Information Protect (AIP) - classifying and protecting documents and emails by applying labels
	- e.g. When user saves .doc file having confidential data like credit card number, a custom tooltip configured by the admin is displayed saying that file be labeled as confidential

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)

Helps identify and investigating advanced threats
Components of ATP :
	- ATP Portal - monitor and respond to suspicious activities
	- ATP Sensors - Installed directly on domain controllers, monitor traffic
	- ATP Cloud Service

Understanding Security considerations for Application Lifecycle Mgmt

- Provide training => everyone must know how to build security into software
- Define security requirement into the initial planning stages of product development
- Define metrics and threshhold for security requirements to be met during production
- Define and use cryptography standards
- Manage security risks from using third-party components and use approved tools
- Static Analysis Security Testing - compile time verification of code
- Dynamic Analysis Security Testing - runtime verification
- Perform penetration testing - Simuating actions of a hacker on the app
- Establish a standard incident response process
