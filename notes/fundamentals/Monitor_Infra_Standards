Define IT compliance with Azure Policy

Azure Policy
	- service which allows you to create, assign and manage policices
	- After policy is implemented, azure makes sure that all the existing and newly created resources are
	  compliant
	- Azure Policy vs RBAC(Role based access control) - who can create a resource => RBAC, specifications of resources 
	  that can be created => Azure Policy

	1 Creating a policy : 
		- Create a policy defn
		- assign defn to a scope of resources
		- view policy evaluation results
		- e.g {
			  "if": {
			    "allOf": [
			      {
			        "field": "type",
			        "equals": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines"
			      },
			      {
			        "not": {
			          "field": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/sku.name",
			          "in": "[parameters('listOfAllowedSKUs')]"
			        }
			      }
			    ]
			  },
			  "then": {
			    "effect": "Deny"
			  }
			}
		  //allows only virtual machines of specified size

	2 - Register the resource provider => Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.PolicyInsights'

	3 - Get reference of that resource group => $rg = Get-AzResourceGroup -Name '<resourceGroupName>'

	4 - Get a reference to the built-in policy definition that will be assigned => 
		$definition = Get-AzPolicyDefinition | Where-Object { $_.Properties.DisplayName -eq 'Audit VMs that do not use managed disks' }

	5 - Create the policy assignment with the built-in definition against your resource group =>
		New-AzPolicyAssignment -Name 'audit-vm-manageddisks' -DisplayName 'Audit VMs without managed disks Assignment' -Scope $rg.ResourceId -PolicyDefinition $definition
  	
  	6 - Observe the results on azure portal
  		Policy Effects
  			- Deny = The resource creation/update fails due to policy.
  			- Disabled = The policy rule is ignored (disabled). Often used for testing.
  			- Append = adds additional params during creation or update of resource
  			- Audit = creates warning event for non compliant process but doesn't stop request
  			- DeployIfNotExist = Executes a template deployment when a specific condition is met.

Initiatives 

Initiative definitions simplify the process of managing and assigning policy definitions by grouping a set of policies into a single item. Defined on a particular scope, contains all the policies applicable to that scope

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azure Management Groups

Azure Management Groups are containers for managing access, policies, and compliance across multiple Azure subscriptions. 
	- e.g. provide user access to multi subscriptions. By moving many subscriptions under that management group, you can create one role-based access control (RBAC) assignment on the management group, which will inherit that access to all the subscriptions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azure Blueprints

Azure Blueprints enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements.
The Azure Blueprints service is designed to help with environment setup. This setup often consists of a set of resource groups, policies, role assignments, and Resource Manager template deployments. A blueprint is a package to bring each of these artifact types together and allow you to compose and version that package -- including through a CI/CD pipeline. Ultimately, each is assigned to a subscription in a single operation that can be audited and tracked.

Microsoft Trust Center

Website containing info about security, privacy, compliance offerings, policies, features, and practices across Microsoft cloud products.

Microsoft Service Trust Portal

hosts the Compliance Manager and information about how Microsoft online services can help your organization maintain and track compliance with standards, laws, and regulations

Microsoft Compliance Manager

track, assign, and verify your organization's regulatory compliance activities related to Microsoft professional services and Microsoft cloud services

Monitoring Health of Apps

1. Azure Monitor 
	- maximizes the availability and performance of your applications by delivering a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments.
	- Types of data sources it can monitor include 
		Application monitoring data - data from the app deployed on azure
		Guest OS monitoring data - data about OS on which app is running (inside or out of azure)
		Azure resource monitoring data - data about azure resources
		Azure subscription monitoring data - data about operation and mgmt of azure subscription
		Azure tenant monitoring data - data about operation of tenant level services like Azure Active Directory

2. Azure Service Health
	- support on azure services and help in planned maintainance
	- Azure Status => health and availability of service
	- Service Health => custom dashboard on system health, 90 days storage of events such as ongoing service issues, upcoming planned maintanance, alerts when service has health issues
	- Resource Health => custom dashbaord, present and past states of resource health saved
