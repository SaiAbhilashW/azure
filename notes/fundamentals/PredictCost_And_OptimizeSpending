Factors affecting cost

- Resource Type 
	- Many billing meters can be attached to a single resource which determine what you'll pay

- Services
	- Azure usage rates and billing periods can differ between Enterprise, Web Direct, and Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) customers

- Location
	- Some loactions are cheaper than other but you should consider the cost to move data there while making the decision

- Azure Billing Zones
	- Billing zones are created to bill based on the amount of data going out of the datacenters. Incoming data is free.
	- 1 = United States, US Government, Europe, Canada, UK, France, Switzerland
	  2 = East Asia, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, India, Korea
	  3 = Brazil, South Africa, UAE
	  4 = DE Zone 1 = Germany

- Billed as pay-for-what-you-use
- Metrics(meters) used for tracking usage :
	- Compute Hours
	- IP Address Hours
	- Data Transfer In
	- Data Transfer Out
	- Standard Managed Disk
	- Standard Managed Disk Operations
	- Standard IO-Disk
	- Standard IO-Block Blob Read
	- Standard IO-Block Blob Write
	- Standard IO-Block Blob Delete

- Deallocating a VM != deleting a VM - Deallocating is similar to turning off a computer, you won't be charged for computing, data transfers etc, but you'd be charged for storage space.
- Billing happens monthly
