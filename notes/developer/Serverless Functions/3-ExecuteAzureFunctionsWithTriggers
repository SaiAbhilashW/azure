Run Azure fucntion on a scehdule
--------------------------------

Timer trigger executes a function at consistent interval. You need to give 2 infos:
- Timestamp paramter name : identifier to access the trigger in code
- CRON - expression which sets the interval for timer

CRON Expression:
string consists of 6 fields representing set of times

{second} {minute} {hour} {day} {week}
e.g 0*/5 * * * * -> executes the funtion every 5 minutes

* - select every value in the field - every minute of an hour, every hour of a day, every day of a month so on

, - seperate items in a list - "1,3" in days field means Monday and Wednesday

- - specific range - 10-13 in hour field means 10,11,12 and 13th hour

/ - specifies an increment - */10 in minutes field means every 10 minutes

e.g 0 */5 10-12 2,4 * means job will run every 5 minutes between 10am to 12pm on Tuesday and Thursday every week


HTTP Triggers
-------------

Trigger which executes a funciton when it recieves HTTP request

Some capabilities and customizations for HTTP triggers:
- provides authorized access by supplying keys
- restrict which http verbs are supported
- return data back to caller
- recieve data through a query string or a request body
- support URL route templates to modify function URL

HTTP Trigger Auth Levels :
A flag which indicates if an incoming HTTP request needs API key for auth

1. Function
2. Admin/ Host
3. Anonymous

Anonymous - no auth needed
Funtion and Admin - auth key needed. Function key when given in a request can access only that particular function. Admin key when provided can give access to all functions inside the function app.


Blob Trigger
------------

Blob Storage:
Object storage solution designed to store large amounts of unstructured data
Great for doing things like:
- Storing files
- Serving files
- Streaming video and audio
- logging data

Three types of blobs:
- Block - store text or binary data
- Append - designed for log files or ones which are updated more frequently
- Page - made of pages, designed for random read/write operations

Blob Trigger executes the function when file is uploaded or updated in Azure Blob Storage

Blob Trigger creation:
- need to give path file to monitor to the trigger

e.g samples-workitems/{name}.txt

So the trigger will execute whenever a text file is updated/uploaded in the samples-workitems container

The trigger function recieves the {name} of the file as a parameter to the function
So if resume.txt is uploaded, function gets name=resume
