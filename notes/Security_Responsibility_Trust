Protect Your Network

- Layered approach

	- Internet facing resources
		- allow inbound and outbound traffic only when neccesary
		- Azure Security Center identifies internet facing resources without security groups
		  or those which are not behind the firewall.

	Firewall - Allows server access to only a selected range of IP addresses defined by you
		-	Azure Firewall - Firewall as a service by azure, inbound protection for Remote Desktop
			Protocol, File Transfer Protocol and Secure Shell
		-	Azure Application gateway - load balancer includes Web App Firewall, for HTTP traffic

	Network Virtual appliances - ideal for non HTTP services


- Stopping Distributed Denial of Service Attacks
	These attacks attempt to overwhelm a resource by sending too many requests
	- Azure DDoS protection identifies the attacker and blocks him while letting customers access the service

- Controlling traffic inside the VNet
	- Network Security Gropus => Allow us to control traffic between azure resources in the vnet
	- ExpressRoute - establish VPN connection between with azure and your on premise network

Protecting shared documents

Microsoft Azure Information Protect (AIP) - classifying and protecting documents and emails by applying labels
	- e.g. When user saves .doc file having confidential data like credit card number, a custom tooltip configured by
		   the admin is displayed saying that file be labeled as confidential

Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)

Helps identify and investigating advanced threats
Components of ATP :
	- ATP Portal - monitor and respond to suspicious activities
	- ATP Sensors - Installed directly on domain controllers, monitor traffic
	- ATP Cloud Service

Understanding Security considerations for Application Lifecycle Mgmt

- Provide training => everyone must know how to build security into software
- Define security requirement into the initial planning stages of product development
- Define metrics and threshhold for security requirements to be met during production
- Define and use cryptography standards
- Manage security risks from using third-party components and use approved tools
- Static Analysis Security Testing - compile time verification of code
- Dynamic Analysis Security Testing - runtime verification
- Perform penetration testing - Simuating actions of a hacker on the app
- Establish a standard incident response process
